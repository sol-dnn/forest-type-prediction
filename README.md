## Kaggle Challenge -  Forest Cover Type Prediction

In this repository, we present a comprehensive analysis of a Kaggle machine learning project focused on predicting cover types in forest areas using different geographical, cartographic, and environmental data.

### Data
The dataset contains information obtained from the US Forest Service (USFS) Region 2 Resource Information System (RIS) data, as well as data from the US Geological Survey (USGS). Our main goal is to build an accurate predictive model that can classify the forest cover type from the data.
One of the challenges of this competition is the larger amount of data in the test set. The datasets consist of both quantitative and qualitative attributes, including among others elevation, aspect, slope, distances to hydrology features and roadways, sunlight exposure (hillshade), wilderness area designations, and soil type designations. There are four wilderness areas in the dataset, each represented by a binary column indicating its presence or absence. Similarly, there are 40 binary columns representing different soil types based on the USFS Ecological Landtype Units (ELUs) for the study area.

### Target Variable 
The forest cover type is the predictor while the other attributes serve as predictors. It includes seven classes: Spruce/Fir, Lodgepole Pine, Ponderosa Pine, Cottonwood/Willow, Aspen, Douglas- fir, and Krummholz. Each cover type is represented by an integer value ranging from 1 to 7.

### Objective
Our goal is to employ advanced methods, including preparing the data in different ways with advanced feature engineering, fine-tuning model settings with hyperparameter optimization, and using different machine learning models to get better results and improve our predictive performance.


With a clear understanding of our objectives and of the dataset’s overall structure, we will proceed with the exploratory data analysis (EDA) phase to glean insights into the dataset’s characteristics. Subsequently, we will cover data preprocessing, feature engineering, model evaluation, and testing phases. We used this approach aiming to develop reliable and accurate machine learning models for forest cover type prediction.
